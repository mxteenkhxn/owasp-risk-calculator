## 📌 Project Summary

The **OWASP Risk Calculator** is a sleek and interactive web tool that implements the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) to help security professionals and organizations assess security risks based on various technical and business factors.

This project simplifies complex risk analysis through a clean, modern UI and live calculation of risk scores. It's fully **client-side**, lightweight, and fast.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The app is divided into four major categories of input:

1. **Threat Agent Factors** (Skill Level, Motive, Opportunity, Size)
2. **Vulnerability Factors** (Ease of Discovery, Exploit, Awareness, Detection)
3. **Technical Impact** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Accountability)
4. **Business Impact** (Financial, Reputation, Legal, Privacy)

Each input has a score from 0–9. The app:

- Averages values in each category
- Calculates:
  - **Likelihood Score** = Avg of Threat Agent & Vulnerability
  - **Impact Score** = Avg of Technical & Business Impact
  - **Risk Rating** based on a matrix of both

➡️ The result is shown in real time — no need to click submit!
